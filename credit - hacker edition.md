SPECIFICATION:

Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm.

In credit.c, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, per the definitions of each’s format herein.

So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less, and that main always return 0.

Do not assume that the user’s input will fit in an int!
