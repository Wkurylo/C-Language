SPECIFICATION:

Implement a program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a specified height.

To make things more interesting, first prompt the user for the half-pyramids' heights, a non-negative integer no greater than 23. (The height of the half-pyramids pictured above happens to be 4, the width of each half-pyramid 4, with an a gap of size 2 separating them.)

If the user fails to provide a non-negative integer no greater than 23, you should re-prompt for the same again.
